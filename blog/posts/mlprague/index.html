            <article class="post-content"><p>Last week, I joined machine learning enthusiasts from around the world in Prague for Europe&rsquo;s biggest conference on ML and AI applications, <a href="https://mlprague.com/" target="_blank">ML Prague 2023</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/media/mlprague_sign.jpg" alt="ML Prague Conference 2023 sign at the entrance" /></p>

<p>The event featured a broad lineup of speakers, covering a wide range of topics - from the latest breakthroughs in natural language processing to cutting-edge computer vision applications. In this blog post, I want to write about some of the most interesting talks from the conference and highlight the key takeaways. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s dive in and start with two topics from the area of image processing.</p>

<h2 id="image-processing">Image Processing</h2>

<h3 id="3d-pose-estimation-in-sport">3D Pose Estimation in Sport</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-skalski-36b5b4122/" target="_blank">Piotr Skalski</a> from Roboflow showed us how he was able to reproduce parts of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system shown in the following clip.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WycjDx6giVE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>He used <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7" target="_blank">YOLOv7</a> and two cameras that record from different perspectives to track a skeleton of his body.</p>

<p>When using this technique, there are some key points to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>at least</strong> two cameras with the same configuration

<ul>
<li>For best results, position them above the playing field to reduce player occlusions</li>
<li>For better results, use more than two cameras</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Avoid or remove any lens distortion before processing the video recordings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at his <a href="https://github.com/SkalskiP/sport" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> to see the results.</p>

<h3 id="multi-model-machine-learning-based-industrial-vision-tool-for-assembly-part-quality-control">Multi-Model Machine Learning based Industrial Vision Tool for Assembly Part Quality Control</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimira-baitieva/?originalSubdomain=cz" target="_blank">Aimira Baitieva</a> from Valeo offered insights into anomaly detection in images using neural networks.</p>

<p>One interesting idea was to train a model that outputs embeddings for images, which represent their information well enough. You could then create a <em>&ldquo;good&rdquo;</em> embedding for normal parts (without anomalies) to compare against. If an embedded image has a dissimilarity above a certain threshold when compared with the good embedding, one can mark it as an anomaly.</p>

<p>Their final <strong>multi-model</strong> approach, consisted of three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a segmented anomaly map:

<ol>
<li>Segment the image to get a segmentation map</li>
<li>Use an anomaly detector to get an anomaly map</li>
<li>Combine both maps</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Extract features from this map</li>
<li>Classify the image based on the features.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/blog/media/mlprague_valeo.jpg" alt="Image at Conference of multi-model approach" /></p>

<p>This turned out to work well and is in use right now.</p>

<h2 id="large-language-models">Large Language Models</h2>

<h3 id="llm-driven-game-characters">LLM-driven Game Characters</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marekrosa1/?originalSubdomain=cz" target="_blank">Marek Rosa</a> from GoodAI shared their progress in creating LLM-driven game characters.</p>

<p>In their AI Game, characters use a large language model to generate their thoughts, actions and speech. The player can interact with them via a chat interface and with normal in-game actions like exchanging objects.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G7ZAPwji4i0?start=92" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Every character has a long-term memory in the form of a vector database. The app preprocesses new thoughts and interactions and saves them into the database. When needed, it queries the database based on</p>

<ul>
<li>recency</li>
<li>importance</li>
<li>and relevance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current context of the language model forms the short-term memory. This combination of short and long-term memory let&rsquo;s agents learn continually by using it to plan actions based on past observations, experience, its current environment and thoughts.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that LLMs will redefine the role of NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in video games. Today, the player-controlled character is often the central figure in the game&rsquo;s story while other characters are less important.
In the future, the player will take on a more supporting role and the game does not have a defined protagonist. The story will be open-ended and allows the players <strong>and</strong> NPCs to make choices that affect the outcome and direction of it.
More games will adopt a sandbox-style approach, like Minecraft, where there is no clear goal or ending of the game.</p>

<p>Other interesting projects that try to use LLMs to create autonomous agents are</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT" target="_blank">AutoGPT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager" target="_blank">Voyager Minecraft Agent</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the ML Prague Conference 2023 was a fantastic opportunity for ML professionals to come together, learn about the latest trends and innovations in the field, and connect with others. I had a great time and am glad that I was able to be there. I hope you enjoyed this short recap of the conference. If you&rsquo;ve been there too, let&rsquo;s connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcjulian/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and have a chat about <strong>your</strong> favorite talks.</p>
