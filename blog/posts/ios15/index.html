            <article class="post-content"><p>As of today I have tested the first iOS 15 Beta for at least two weeks. And, I am happy with the new features added. But some of them stood out to me:</p>

<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2>

<p>Apple markets it to be <em>reimagined for the way we browse today.</em> The tab and search bar dropped from the top of the screen right to the bottom where it&rsquo;s easier to reach with one hand. Swiping across the bar will switch between all opened tabs. At first I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the new UI, it took some time to get used to the new gestures. But to be fair, Safari got lots of other great new functionalities. A customizable start page, privacy protections with <em>iCloud+ Private Relay</em> (although I wasn&rsquo;t able to use it in the beta version yet), the ability to add web extensions and a grid-like tab overview.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>

<p>Apple made long requested changes to the notification system. Notifications are now ranked by priority to make sure that the most urgent ones are always at the top. iOS now delivers a helpful notification summary every day so you can see what&rsquo;s new at a glance.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>Strongly connected to notifications is the all new <em>Focus</em> mode. It&rsquo;s basically an extension to the  <em>&ldquo;Do not disturb mode&rdquo;</em> which silences all incoming notifications. Focus can automatically filter notifications to your liking. But thats not all. You can even specify which homescreens iOS will show during an activated Focus mode.</p>

<h2 id="spotlight-search-live-text">Spotlight Search + Live Text</h2>

<p>The already beloved spotlight search got a complete revamp. It&rsquo;s now faster, more detailed and the new live text feature adds so much more functionality to it. You can now search for text which appears in your images. For people who take lots of screenshots, this can be a big time-saver.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>

<p>I can see the problems people might have with the updated Safari UI but I do think that they will get used to it and in the end appreciate having the ability to use Safari one-handedly.</p>

<p>For me personally, the best feature in iOS 15 is the Focus mode. I already set up a <em>Learning mode</em> which automatically changes my homescreen to display relevant apps and widgets (e.g. Notability, Calendar, Reminders, Files, and other university related apps). Also any messages which weren&rsquo;t sent by my fellow students or professors don&rsquo;t show up. It helps me get less distracted when learning or working.</p>

<p>As I said in the beginning, iOS 15 gave us lots of small upgrades which will enhance the experience with your Apple devices. Nothing big, but great nonetheless.</p>
